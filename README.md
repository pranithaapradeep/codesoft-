Players try to guess the number within a limited number of attempts.
Feedback is provided for each guess: too high, too low, or correct.
Supports multiple rounds so players can keep playing.
Tracks score based on how many rounds the user wins.
Demonstrates use of loops, conditionals, user input, and random number generation.
Clean and console-based â€” no external libraries required.
